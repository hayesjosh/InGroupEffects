This is one of the analyses of my doctoral dissertation at University of California Davis. 

I designed this project while struggling with the challenges of doing comparative research on religion across nations. Religious contexts, such as religious demographics and relative cultural/historical importance, differ greatly across nations. But of course researchers are still very interested in cross-national comparisons! But how do we deal with the fact that a Protestant in America's "Bible Belt" likely has many important differences from a Protestant in the north of India? Or that being a Muslim in Morocco is quite different from being a Muslim in Mexico? Past research has often just collapsed religious groups together (e.g. Protestants = 1, Catholics = 2, Muslims = 3, etc.), and has found some interesting results. But in doing so, past researchers also lost the ability to see social contexts.  

I was inspired to do this project after looking at economists' research. Economists struggle with international comparisons too because the value of a single unit of currency changes drastically across nations. However, economists have developed strategies to capture the contextual influence of wealth. Rather than looking at "Absolute Wealth" (the amount of wealth a respondent has), they measured "Relative Wealth" (the amount of wealth one has compared to their fellow citizens). For example, this allows researchers to plainly see the impact of being in the lower 50% of wage-earners, compared across all nations. A lot of very interesting findings have come out of these analyses.

I took the same logic of shifting focus from "absolute" values:

**(# of dollars)** or **(specific religious affiliation)**

to "relative" values:

**(amount of wealth relative to others)** or **(population density of one's religion compared to other religions)**.

That allows me to ask all sorts of interesting questions such as, "Does being a member of a country's dominant religion have an influence? Do Protestants in the United States have significant similarities to Muslims in Morocco because they both are members of the historically dominant religions?" and "What about being a member of a minority religion? Do Muslims in the United States and Christians in India tend to feel the same because they both have to contend with being members of minority religions within their society?" 

In one chapter of my dissertation, I use this framework to test the following questions across numerous nations and years:

     1. Do citizens and non-citizens differ on how they see the importance of citizenship to be a "true member of the nation"?
     2. Do members of dominant religions and minority religions differ on how they see the importance of being a member of the dominant religion in order to be a "true member of the nation"?
     3. Are either of the above relationships changing over time? Are groups becoming more divided? Or agreeing more?

I found the results quite interesting! Here you can see my Stata code and a sample of my resulting analyses. 

Let's take a look!
